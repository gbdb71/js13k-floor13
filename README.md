## Setting up the project

_Pixel Wars_ is built using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/). Before running any task, dependencies must be retrieved using `npm`.

    npm install

## Developping

Two tasks are exposed:

- `dev` builds debug files.
- `package` (_default_) minifies the game and create the ZIP archive.

## Building the game archive

Run `grunt` to generate the ZIP archive.
The archive is located at `dist/pixelwars.zip`.
